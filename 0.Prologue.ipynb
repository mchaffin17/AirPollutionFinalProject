    "The World Health Organization reported that in 2012 about 7 million people died as a result of air pollution exposure, a finding that was more than double previous estimates.  According to the WHO, this finding “confirms that air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk.”  Air pollution can lead to a variety of potentially fatal conditions such as heart disease, stroke, COPD, and lung cancer.  Thus it is critical that more research on air pollution causes and interventions to reduce such pollution be done.\n",
    " \n",
    "As students at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, we want to conduct some research into air pollution in the USA as well as on some of the determinants of such pollution such as weather, commuting, and population density given the severity of this public health issue.  By understanding the pollutant profiles of various cities, more targeted and effective interventions for reducing pollution on a by-pollutant-type basis could then be proposed and implemented.  Linking these specific profiles to certain determinants would also aid in the creation of powerful air pollution reduction policies.  These various analyses could be useful for developing legislation across the USA.  Additionally, we could predict the pollutant profiles of cities in the third world, where such measuring of pollutants is not available, based on weather, population, etc.  Such prediction would allow for better formulation of air pollution reduction policies for those cities."

    "##Key Findings\n",
    "Based on our analysis, air quality appears to be a composite of many features, some related to human activity and some related to environmental sources. The relative contribution of these two sources seems to vary across pollutants which has implications about how to design effective overall air quality interventions. Using multiple modeling approaches, we find that some pollutant concentrations, such as NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, are easier to predict than others. Additionally, US cities can be clustered into distinct pollutant profiles which are differentiated by environmental and demographic factors.<br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Airborne NO<sub>2</sub>, PM2.5, and O<sub>3</sub> of cities can be somewhat predicted based on demographic and weather features, but PM10, CO, and SO<sub>2</sub> are not well described from these characteristics</li>\n",
    "<li>Prediction models based on US cities do not extend well to French cities</li>\n",
    "<li>The relative importance of anthropogenic and environmental factors to air pollutant concentrations varies between pollutants</li>\n",
    "<li>Distinct types of cities exist that can be characterized by their particular pollutant profiles</li>\n",
    " <ul><li>These clusters can be differentiated by liquid precipitation, air pressure, temperature, and land area</li></ul>\n",
    "<li>Imputation of cluster identities for US cities with missing data allows us to increase the coverage of US cities, and seems to be fairly reliable.</li>\n",
    "<li>When French cities were clustered with the same method, their pollutant profiles looked reasonably similar to the clustered US pollutant profiles.</li>\n",
